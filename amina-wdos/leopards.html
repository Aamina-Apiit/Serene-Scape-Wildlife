            Threat 1: Habitat Loss and Fragmentation

          <h1 class="pad">Description:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Human activities such as deforestation and urbanisation cause habitat loss and fragmentation, which pose a severe danger to leopard populations in Sri Lanka. Leopards are having difficulty establishing acceptable territories as their natural habitats disappear, resulting in greater human-wildlife conflict.
          </p>
          <h1 class="pad">Consequences:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            The effects include decreased prey availability, greater confrontation with people, and a higher chance of inbreeding among isolated leopard populations.
          </p>
          <h1 class="pad">Mechanisms to Reduce Threat:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            To mitigate habitat loss, conservation efforts focus on reforestation projects, creating wildlife corridors, and promoting sustainable land-use practices. Protected area management and community education are also crucial to reducing human-leopard conflicts.

            Threat 2: Illegal Wildlife Trade<br>
          </h2>

          <h1 class="pad">Description:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Illegal wildlife trade, especially the trafficking of leopard parts and live cubs, is a major threat to leopard populations. Poaching for leopard skin, bones, and other body parts adds to the fall in leopard population.
          </p>
          <h1 class="pad">Consequences:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Illegal wildlife trading has several implications, including a decline in leopard numbers, disruption of the natural ecology, and a threat to the region's biodiversity.
          </p>
          <h1 class="pad">Mechanisms to Reduce Threat:</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            Efforts to combat the illegal wildlife trade include enhancing anti-poaching measures, improving law enforcement, and raising awareness about the importance of leopard conservation. Collaboration with foreign organisations is also critical for addressing the global components of the illegal wildlife trafficking.
